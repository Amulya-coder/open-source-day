As part of the Contribution Track, you will contribute code to our partner open source software (OSS) projects. You will work in groups, where you’ll have opportunities to learn from one another, as well as from experienced mentors, there to guide and help you make your OSS contribution. 

Additionally, we have a "Choose your own adventure" option, where you have the opportunity to contribute code to projects led by women maintainers or to just any project in the OSS community.

**New to Open Source? Don’t worry! You will not be alone;** We will guide you through finding issues that are suited for your skill level and there will be mentors ready to help you.

Participants in this Open Source Day project will learn about multiple ways of openSUSE contributions and how to become an openSUSE Member. In addition, they receive an insight how to enable application software as Container Images or packages. Do you want to help make a contribution? Then go to an openSUSE Mentor and you will be allowed to receive your first openSUSE experience on a mainframe with the name LinuxONE (outside of your pc hardware experience). We support you during your first steps with contributions to Linux. We are open for all questions, too. | [Berthold Gunreben](https://github.com/azouhr) and [Sarah Julia Kriesch](https://github.com/skriesch) |
