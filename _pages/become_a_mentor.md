Thank you for your interest in applying to be a mentor for OSD 2021! Mentors application
is opened!

Open Source Day (OSD) is an opportunity for attendees of all skill levels and backgrounds to 
learn and experience open source contribution with the support of experienced mentors and 
the project's maintainers, providing a fast track to becoming one of the projects contributors, 
gaining experience and knowledge on open source processes and technologies and adding valuable 
skills to their resume. 

Many OSD attendees will be contributing to open source projects for the first time. 
To support them and ensure their experience is positive and fun, we are looking for 
mentors that will walk the attendees through finding a project and an issue, explaining 
the contribution requirements of the project, working on a solution, and then going through 
the code review process to close the issue.

### When can I apply to be a mentor? 
We are currently in the process of signing up projects to participate in OSD. Whenever a 
project is added, the application for that project is opened. Register above to get 
informed when new projects are added.

### When will I know if I was accepted? 
We will review applications every Monday and Thursday at 5PM PDT. 

Status letters will be sent 1-2 days after.

### What skills make a good OSD mentor?
To be successful as an OSD mentor, besides feeling comfortable with a project tech stack, 
you will need to feel comfortable using git, communicating in code reviews and mentoring 
others. We also ask that you become a contributor of a project before applying to become 
its mentor. 

### Why do I need to become a contributor?
Each Open Source project has different onboarding process for new contributors. OSD 
participants will need to follow this process for their changes to be submitted and we
discovered that knowing this process is important to your success as a mentor.

The mentors application includes links to each project's contribution guide. 
Follow this guide to find good first issue, and open a pull request that resolves the issue.

Paste a link to the pull request in your application!

* Participate in an online training (~1hr)
* Review your assigned project's documentation and setup and propose improvements
