As part of the Learn Track, you will spend your day attending hands-on workshops that will help you overcome the barriers of making open source contributions. Learn about the Open Source community and get familiar with the tools to contribute, build and maintain open source projects. Speakers will relate the session topics to their own experiences as contributors and maintainers in the OSS community.

    How do you get started with Open Source? If youâ€™ve never contributed to an open source project before, making your first contribution can be intimidating. Not to mention, it can be difficult to know where to begin. Join us to learn everything you need to know about the Open Source community and how to make your first contribution! Hear stories from women in engineering about their open source involvement and contributions.

    "Do you want to contribute to Kubernetes? Not sure how or where to begin? It can be overwhelming! But fear not - you can join the thousands of successful contributors too!
    In this new contributor workshop, we will explore how the Kubernetes community is structured, discuss the skills the attendees need to get started and learn the best ways to get their first Pull Request accepted.
    After this talk, contributing to Kubernetes will no longer be intimidating. The attendees will be able to fix any bugs that they encounter in their day job or otherwise."

    This workshop invites you to explore how you can create more inclusive open source code, docs and communities, with a focus on language. Many open source projects are still filled with exclusionary language that can have a negative impact on people even while not being used with exclusionary intent. We'll look at someÂ such examples of technical and nontechnical terms with problematic origins and connotations, discuss more inclusive alternatives, and then practise addressing "inclusion debt" in projects. You'll also learn that like tech debt, inclusion debt is also never done because language use is always shifting. Your projects will need multiple perspectives to shift and grow with it!
